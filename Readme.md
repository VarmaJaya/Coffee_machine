Coffee Machine Program
This Python project simulates a coffee machine that offers three drink options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The program allows users to order drinks, processes payments in coins, checks if there are enough resources to fulfill the order, and maintains a report of the available resources and earnings.

Features:
Drink Options: The user can choose between espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
Resource Management: The program tracks available water, milk, and coffee to ensure there are enough ingredients to prepare the selected drink.
Coin Processing: The user inserts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) to pay for the drink. The program calculates the total amount inserted.
Transaction Handling: The program checks if enough money is inserted for the selected drink, returns change if applicable, and refunds the money if it's insufficient.
Resource Report: The user can generate a report showing the current levels of water, milk, coffee, and total earnings.
Shutdown Option: The program can be shut down by typing "off."
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Run the Python script and follow the prompts to select a drink, insert coins, and receive your coffee.
Example Workflow:
Input: latte
Insert: 10 quarters, 2 dimes
Output: "Here is $1.50 in change. Here is your latte â˜•. Enjoy!"
